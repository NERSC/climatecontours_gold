                        <p>This tool will help create ground truth labeled data
                            for the ClimateNet project. The tool is based
                            on the open-source LabelMe project released by MIT. </br></br>

                            The current goal is to label Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) and
                            Tropical Cyclones (TCs) on simulated climate output from
                            the 25km CAM5.1 climate model. As a first step, users will
                            work with images of the integrated water vapor field and use
                            the tool to draw n-sided polygons around events of interest
                            and indicate the type of event (TC or AR) for each polygon.
                            The number &#39n&#39 is the user&#39s choice, depending on
                            how complex the shape of the event is and how precise the
                            user wishes the boundary to be. We recommend O(10) points
                            for each event. </br></br>

                            When you enter the tool, an image from the database will be
                            randomly selected and shown. You help create ground truth labels
                            by drawing polygons around and annotating as many atmospheric
                            rivers and tropical cyclones as possible. </br></br>

                            Note that images will contain previously labeled events,
                            which are meant to offer you with examples to get started.
                            Please modify pre-existing labels or delete and replace them as
                            you deem fit to accurately indicate the events present in the image.
                            Once you have completed labeling all events in an image, you can
                            view a new image by pressing the "show next image" button.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The following steps describe how to label an object:</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        1. Start by pressing the left
                        mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
                        <br />2. Continue clicking along the boundary of the object
                        to create a polygon. Each click generates a new vertex of the
                            n-sided polygon.
                        <br />3. Once you have finished
                        clicking along the boundary of the object, either click on
                        the first point or press the right mouse button to complete
                        the polygon.
                        <br />4. A window will now appear asking to choose the event's type.
                        That is, "Atmospheric River" or "Tropical Cyclone". Please select the
                        correct event type and click the "Done" button.
                        </p>

                        <p>The following are some recomendations for how to provide annotations
                        that are as useful as possible. </p>
                        <p><strong>View the entire image: </strong> Make sure that
                        your browser occupies the entire screen and that you scroll
                        to see the entire image.  If you label an object on the edge
                        of your browser, make sure to scroll so that the entire
                        object is visible.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Follow the object outline: </strong> Click on top of the object 
                        boundary so that the polygon accurately delineates the object outline. 
                        The ideal outline should be good enough for somebody to recognize the 
                        object just by seeing the drawn polygon.</p>
                        <p><strong>Labeling occluded objects: </strong>Sometimes objects will 
                        be only partially visible. This is especially true for atmospheric rivers.
                        We recommend in these cases to complete the boundary as if they were not 
                        occluded. </p>
                        <p><strong>Labeling small events: </strong> Sometimes events like TCs will be
                        small and difficult to label accurately without zooming in. Zoom in on the image
                        with buttons in the uppermost block to the left of the image. </p>

                </tr>

                        <p><strong>Delete segments: </strong>If you want to delete one segment 
                        of the polygon before finishing the polygon, press the <code>delete</code> 
                        key. Once the polygon is closed, you can not delete control points or 
                        add new segments, but you can modify the location of the control points.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modify control points:</strong> 
                        Once you have finished a polygon, you can modify individual control 
                        points. If you click on top of the polygon, the control
                        points will appear. 
                        You can select one of the control points (hold the left mouse button 
                        down) and move it to a new position. Then click anywhere in the image 
                        to deselect the polygon. This will also save the modified polygon. </p>
                        <p><strong>Delete entire polygon: </strong>Select the polygon. You will
                            have the option to delete the polygon.</p>
